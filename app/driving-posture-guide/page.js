const faqData = [
  {
    question: "What is the correct driving position?",
    answer: "Sit with back fully against seat, knees slightly bent when fully extending pedals, hands at 9 and 3 o'clock on steering wheel, headrest touching back of head, and seat reclined 100-110 degrees (slightly back from vertical). Adjust mirrors after seat position is set."
  },
  {
    question: "How far should I sit from the steering wheel?",
    answer: "Sit close enough that your wrists rest on top of steering wheel when arms are extended straight (shoulders still against seat). This ensures knees stay slightly bent at full brake pedal extension and steering wheel is within comfortable reach."
  },
  {
    question: "Should my seat be reclined or upright?",
    answer: "Recline seat back 100-110 degrees (slightly back from vertical). Sitting bolt upright (90 degrees) increases lower back strain. Reclining too far (120+ degrees) forces you to crane neck forward to see road. Slight recline is optimal."
  },
  {
    question: "What causes back pain while driving?",
    answer: "Common causes: seat too far from pedals (straightens legs completely), seat reclined too far (rounds upper back), no lumbar support, poor seat cushion, prolonged sitting without breaks, and vibration from rough roads. Most are fixable with proper setup."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I take breaks on long drives?",
    answer: "Stop every 90-120 minutes for 5-10 minute break. Get out of car, walk around, do gentle stretches (neck rolls, back extension, hip stretches). This prevents stiffness, improves circulation, and maintains alertness. Set timer to remind you."
  },
  {
    question: "Can driving posture cause permanent damage?",
    answer: "Chronic poor driving posture over years can contribute to disc problems, muscle imbalances, and postural changes, but damage is typically reversible with corrected setup and exercises. Professional drivers (truck drivers, delivery) are higher risk and should be especially careful about setup and breaks."

          <ShortAnswer>
            Proper driving posture has your seat close enough that knees stay slightly bent at full pedal extension, back fully supported by seat, hands at 9 and 3 o'clock on steering wheel, and headrest touching the back of your head. Adjust mirrors after seat setup, never before.
          </ShortAnswer>

          <KeyTakeaways takeaways={keyTakeaways} />

          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
            
            <p className="text-lg">
              Average person spends 1-2 hours daily driving. Poor car posture causes back pain, neck strain, and fatigue. Proper setup prevents pain on both short commutes and long road trips.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Car Posture Causes Pain</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Fixed position:</strong> Can't stand or move like at desk</li>
              <li><strong>Vibration:</strong> Road vibration stresses spine</li>
              <li><strong>Asymmetry:</strong> Right foot on pedals, both hands on wheel creates uneven strain</li>
              <li><strong>Limited adjustability:</strong> Car seats have fewer adjustments than office chairs</li>
              <li><strong>Poor factory settings:</strong> Most people never adjust from default position</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Seat Position Adjustment</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Do this first—everything else depends on seat position.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3>Distance from Pedals</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Sit with back fully against seat</li>
              <li>Place right foot on brake pedal</li>
              <li>Press brake fully to floor</li>
              <li>Knee should have slight bend (15-20 degrees)</li>
              <li>If leg is completely straight, move seat forward</li>
              <li>If knee is bent more than 20 degrees, move seat back</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              <strong>Test:</strong> With shoulders against seat, extend arms straight. Wrists should rest on top of steering wheel. If you can't reach, seat is too far back.
            </p>

            <h3>Seat Height (If Adjustable)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>High enough to see road clearly over steering wheel</li>
              <li>Not so high that head touches or nearly touches ceiling</li>
              <li>Thighs should rest lightly on seat, not pressed hard</li>
              <li>Usually 1-2 inches between head and ceiling is ideal</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Seat Angle (If Adjustable)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Seat pan slightly tilted up in front (few degrees)</li>
              <li>This prevents sliding forward</li>
              <li>Thighs should be supported without pressure behind knees</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Backrest Angle</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Optimal:</strong> 100-110 degrees (slightly reclined from vertical)
            </p>

            <h3>Why This Angle?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduces lower back disc pressure by 40% vs. sitting upright</li>
              <li>Allows spine to maintain natural curves</li>
              <li>Reduces muscle fatigue</li>
              <li>Improves visibility and control</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Too Upright (90 degrees)</h3>
            <p>
              Increases lower back strain and disc pressure. Feels rigid and uncomfortable on longer drives.
            </p>

            <h3>Too Reclined (120+ degrees)</h3>
            <p>
              Forces you to crane neck forward to see road. Causes shoulder strain from reaching for wheel. Reduces vehicle control.
            </p>

            <h2>Lumbar Support</h2>
            <p>
              Many cars have adjustable lumbar support. If yours does:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Adjust support to fit curve of your lower back (about waist height)</li>
              <li>Should feel gentle pressure, not uncomfortable pushing</li>
              <li>Support should fill gap between seat and lower back</li>
              <li>If no lumbar adjustment, use small cushion or rolled towel</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              <strong>DIY lumbar support:</strong> Roll small towel (3-4 inches diameter), place behind lower back curve. Secure with tape or string if it shifts.
            </p>

            <h2>Steering Wheel and Hand Position</h2>

            <h3>Wheel Height and Reach (If Adjustable)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Top of wheel at or slightly below shoulder height</li>
              <li>Can see instrument cluster clearly over wheel</li>
              <li>Arms slightly bent when hands at 9 and 3 positions</li>
              <li>Wheel not blocking view of road</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hand Position: 9 and 3 O'Clock</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Modern recommendation:</strong> 9 and 3 o'clock (not 10 and 2)
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Why 9 and 3?</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Better vehicle control</li>
              <li>Reduced shoulder strain</li>
              <li>Safer with airbags</li>
              <li>More natural arm position</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Grip Pressure</h3>
            <p>
              Hold wheel firmly but not tightly—about 30-40% grip strength. Death grip causes forearm, shoulder, and neck tension. Relax hands at regular intervals.
            </p>

            <h2>Headrest Position</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Critical for whiplash prevention and neck support.</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Top of headrest at same height as top of head</li>
              <li>Back of head should touch or nearly touch headrest when sitting normally</li>
              <li>Gap between headrest and head should be 2-3 inches maximum</li>
              <li>Headrest angle should match your head angle (not pushing head forward)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Mirror Adjustment</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Adjust mirrors AFTER seat position is set.</strong> Adjusting mirrors first leads to poor seat positioning.
            </p>

            <h3>Rearview Mirror</h3>
            <p>
              Center entire rear window in mirror. Should see road behind without moving head, just eyes.
            </p>

            <h3>Side Mirrors</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Adjust so you barely see side of your car (thin sliver)</li>
              <li>Should see adjacent lane and lane next to it</li>
              <li>Sky should take up about 1/3 of mirror, ground 2/3</li>
              <li>Lean head to left and adjust left mirror until you barely see car side</li>
              <li>Lean head to right and adjust right mirror same way</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This setup minimizes blind spots and reduces need to turn head/body to check mirrors.
            </p>

            <h2>Long Drive Strategies</h2>

            <h3>Take Regular Breaks</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Rule:</strong> Stop every 90-120 minutes for 5-10 minute break
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>What to do during breaks:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Get out of car completely</li>
              <li>Walk around for 3-5 minutes</li>
              <li>Do standing back extension (hands on hips, gently arch backward)</li>
              <li>Neck rolls (5 each direction)</li>
              <li>Hip flexor stretch (lunge position, 20 seconds each side)</li>
              <li>Shoulder rolls</li>
              <li>Hydrate</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>In-Car Micro-Movements</h3>
            <p>
              While driving (safely, of course):
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Shoulder shrugs (at red lights)</li>
              <li>Shoulder blade squeezes</li>
              <li>Grip and release steering wheel</li>
              <li>Ankle circles and pumps</li>
              <li>Subtle posture adjustments (shift weight slightly)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Use Cruise Control</h3>
            <p>
              On highways, cruise control allows you to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Rest right foot flat on floor occasionally</li>
              <li>Alternate weight between buttocks</li>
              <li>Do subtle stretches and movements</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tips for Different Body Types</h2>

            <h3>Shorter Drivers (Under 5'4\")</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>May need seat cushion to reach pedals comfortably</li>
              <li>Ensure you can still see over steering wheel</li>
              <li>May need pedal extenders for proper leg bend</li>
              <li>Lumbar support often needs lowering</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Taller Drivers (Over 6'2\")</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Slide seat all the way back</li>
              <li>May need to recline seat slightly more</li>
              <li>Check headroom—headrest should still support properly</li>
              <li>Consider vehicles with more headroom and legroom</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Back Pain Sufferers</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Extra lumbar support crucial</li>
              <li>Seat with firm (not soft) cushioning</li>
              <li>More frequent breaks (every 60-90 minutes)</li>
              <li>Consider heated seats (warmth relaxes muscles)</li>
              <li>Avoid long drives if possible during flare-ups</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Driving Posture Mistakes</h2>

            <h3>1. Seat Too Far from Pedals</h3>
            <p>
              Legs completely straight when pressing pedals. Causes lower back strain and reduces pedal control.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Death Grip on Steering Wheel</h3>
            <p>
              Gripping too tightly causes forearm, shoulder, and neck tension. Relax grip to 30-40% strength.
            </p>

            <h3>3. One Hand Driving</h3>
            <p>
              Creates asymmetric strain. Use both hands at 9 and 3, especially on longer drives.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Wallet in Back Pocket</h3>
            <p>
              Causes pelvic tilt and uneven pressure. Remove wallet and place in console or front pocket before driving.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Adjusting Mirrors to Compensate for Bad Seat Position</h3>
            <p>
              Always adjust seat first, then mirrors. Never adjust seat to see mirrors better.
            </p>

            <h2>Quick Driving Posture Checklist</h2>
            <p>
              Before each drive (takes 30 seconds):
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>□ Seat distance: Knees slightly bent at full pedal extension</li>
              <li>□ Back fully against seat</li>
              <li>□ Backrest reclined 100-110 degrees</li>
              <li>□ Lumbar support in place</li>
              <li>□ Hands at 9 and 3 o'clock</li>
              <li>□ Headrest touching back of head</li>
              <li>□ Can see all mirrors without moving head</li>
            </ul>
