  {
    question: "What is good walking posture?",
    answer: "Good walking posture has your head up (eyes on horizon, not ground), shoulders back and relaxed, arms swinging naturally at sides, core lightly engaged, and heel striking first with each step rolling through to toes. Walk tall as if string is pulling crown of head upward."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I look at the ground when walking?",
    answer: "No, keep eyes on horizon about 10-15 feet ahead, using peripheral vision for immediate ground hazards. Looking down encourages forward head posture and rounds your upper back. Trust your peripheral vision for obstacles."
  },
  {
    question: "How should my arms swing while walking?",
    answer: "Arms should swing naturally opposite to legs (right arm forward with left leg). Elbows slightly bent, swing from shoulders not elbows, hands relaxed. Avoid keeping arms stiff at sides, in pockets, or crossing center line of body."
  },
  {
    question: "What is proper foot strike when walking?",
    answer: "Heel strikes ground first, weight rolls through mid-foot to toes, push off from ball of foot. This heel-to-toe roll is most efficient and natural. Avoid flat-footed stomping or toe-walking. Wear proper footwear with heel-to-toe drop."
  },
  {
    question: "Can walking improve posture?",
    answer: "Yes, walking with good posture strengthens postural muscles, improves balance, and reinforces proper alignment patterns. Daily 20-30 minute walks with conscious attention to posture significantly improve overall posture over 4-6 weeks."
  },
  {
    question: "How do shoes affect walking posture?",
    answer: "Proper shoes with good arch support, cushioning, and appropriate heel-to-toe drop (8-12mm) support natural gait. High heels alter gait and force forward lean. Worn-out shoes cause compensatory movements. Replace walking shoes every 300-500 miles."

          <ShortAnswer>
            Good walking posture has your head up (eyes on horizon, not ground), shoulders back, arms swinging naturally, and heel striking first with each step. Walk as if a string is pulling the top of your head upward, keeping your spine elongated.

            <p className="text-lg">
              You take 4,000-6,000 steps daily. Poor walking posture reinforces bad patterns thousands of times per day. Proper walking posture strengthens good alignment naturally.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Walking Posture Matters</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Repetition effect:</strong> Thousands of daily steps reinforce posture patterns</li>
              <li><strong>Muscle strengthening:</strong> Good walking posture strengthens postural muscles</li>
              <li><strong>Pain prevention:</strong> Proper gait reduces joint stress and prevents injury</li>
              <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Correct posture makes walking less fatiguing</li>
              <li><strong>Balance:</strong> Good posture improves stability and reduces fall risk</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Perfect Walking Position</h2>

            <h3>Head and Neck</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Head balanced over shoulders (not jutting forward)</li>
              <li>Eyes on horizon 10-15 feet ahead (not on ground)</li>
              <li>Chin parallel to ground</li>
              <li>Neck long, maintaining natural curve</li>
              <li>Imagine string pulling crown of head upward</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Shoulders and Upper Body</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Shoulders back and down (not hunched or elevated)</li>

              <li>Spine elongated, maintaining natural curves</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Arms</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Arms swing naturally from shoulders</li>
              <li>Opposite arm to opposite leg (right arm forward with left leg)</li>
              <li>Elbows slightly bent (about 90 degrees)</li>
              <li>Hands relaxed, not clenched</li>
              <li>Swing forward and back, not across body</li>
              <li>Keep arms out of pockets (restricts natural swing)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hips and Lower Body</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Hips level, not tilting side to side excessively</li>
              <li>Pelvis neutral (not tilted forward or backward)</li>
              <li>Core engaged to stabilize pelvis</li>
              <li>Glutes engaged with each push-off</li>
            </ul>

              <li>Feet point straight ahead (not turned out excessively)</li>
              <li>Natural stride length (not overstriding)</li>
              <li>Knees soft, not locked</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Walking Posture Mistakes</h2>

            <h3>1. Looking Down at Ground</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Why it's bad:</strong> Encourages forward head posture, rounds upper back, puts 15-20 pounds extra pressure on neck.<br/>
              <strong>Fix:</strong> Eyes on horizon 10-15 feet ahead. Use peripheral vision for immediate obstacles. Trust your vision—you don't need to stare at ground.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Hunched Shoulders</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Why it's bad:</strong> Restricts breathing, causes upper back pain, looks defeated.<br/>
              <strong>Fix:</strong> Roll shoulders back and down. Imagine wearing cape that needs to flow behind you. Open chest.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Arms Stiff at Sides or in Pockets</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Why it's bad:</strong> Restricts natural counter-balance, makes walking less efficient, can cause shoulder tension.<br/>
              <strong>Fix:</strong> Let arms swing naturally from shoulders, opposite arm to opposite leg. Keep hands out of pockets.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Overstriding</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Why it's bad:</strong> Heel strikes too far ahead of center of gravity, jarring impact on knees and hips.<br/>
              <strong>Fix:</strong> Natural stride—foot lands under or slightly ahead of body. Increase walking speed with quicker steps, not longer strides.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Phone Walking</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Why it's bad:</strong> Looking down at phone while walking combines terrible posture with safety risk.<br/>
              <strong>Fix:</strong> Stop walking to check phone, or bring phone to eye level while walking. Never walk while looking down at screen.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Shuffling or Flat-Footed Walking</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Why it's bad:</strong> Inefficient, increases fall risk, doesn't strengthen calves properly.<br/>
              <strong>Fix:</strong> Proper heel-to-toe roll with each step. Lift feet fully off ground, don't shuffle or drag.
            </p>

            <h2>Foot Strike and Gait Mechanics</h2>

            <h3>The Heel-to-Toe Roll</h3>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Heel strike:</strong> Outside of heel touches ground first</li>
              <li><strong>Mid-foot:</strong> Weight rolls through center of foot</li>
              <li><strong>Toe-off:</strong> Push off from ball of foot and toes</li>
              <li><strong>Swing phase:</strong> Leg swings through to next heel strike</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Natural Stride Length</h3>
            <p>
              Your natural stride length is comfortable and efficient. Don't artificially lengthen steps—this causes overstriding and joint stress. To walk faster, take quicker steps, not longer strides.
            </p>

            <h3>Cadence (Steps Per Minute)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Casual walking:</strong> 100-120 steps/minute</li>
              <li><strong>Brisk walking:</strong> 120-140 steps/minute</li>
              <li><strong>Exercise walking:</strong> 140-160+ steps/minute</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Walking for Exercise vs. Casual Walking</h2>

            <h3>Exercise Walking (Fitness Walks)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Faster pace (3.5-4.5 mph)</li>
              <li>More pronounced arm swing</li>
              <li>Slightly longer stride (but not overstriding)</li>
              <li>Core actively engaged</li>
              <li>Purposeful, consistent pace</li>
              <li>20-45 minute duration</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Casual Walking (Daily Activities)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Comfortable pace (2.5-3.5 mph)</li>
              <li>Relaxed arm swing</li>
              <li>Natural, comfortable stride</li>
              <li>Core lightly engaged</li>
              <li>Variable pace as needed</li>
              <li>Any duration</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Both benefit from good posture—just adjust intensity and effort level.
            </p>

            <h2>Footwear Considerations</h2>

            <h3>Good Walking Shoes Have:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Arch support:</strong> Matches your foot arch (low, medium, high)</li>
              <li><strong>Cushioning:</strong> Absorbs impact without being too soft</li>
              <li><strong>Heel-to-toe drop:</strong> 8-12mm drop supports natural roll</li>
              <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Bends at ball of foot</li>
              <li><strong>Proper fit:</strong> Thumb's width between longest toe and shoe end</li>
              <li><strong>Good tread:</strong> Provides traction</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Replace Walking Shoes When:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Every 300-500 miles of walking</li>
              <li>Sole shows significant wear</li>
              <li>Shoes feel less cushioned</li>
              <li>You notice increased foot or joint pain</li>
              <li>Typically 6-12 months depending on use</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Daily Walking Practice Tips</h2>

            <h3>Start Each Walk with Posture Check</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Stand tall, head up</li>
              <li>Roll shoulders back and down</li>
              <li>Engage core lightly</li>
              <li>Take first steps mindfully</li>
              <li>Maintain awareness for first 2 minutes</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Mid-Walk Posture Resets</h3>
            <p>
              Every 5-10 minutes during longer walks:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Check: Am I looking up or down?</li>
              <li>Roll shoulders back</li>
              <li>Take three deep breaths</li>
              <li>Re-engage core</li>
              <li>Continue with renewed awareness</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Use Walking Time for Posture Improvement</h3>
            <p>
              Your daily walks are opportunities to strengthen good posture. Twenty minutes of conscious walking posture daily creates significant improvements within 4-6 weeks.
            </p>

            <h2>Walking Posture Progression</h2>

            <h3>Week 1-2: Building Awareness</h3>
            <p>
              Focus on one aspect at a time: head position this week, arm swing next week. Don't try to perfect everything simultaneously. Awareness comes before change.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 3-4: Developing Habit</h3>
            <p>
              Good walking posture starting to feel more natural. Still requires conscious attention but less exhausting than week 1.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 5-8: Automatic Improvement</h3>
            <p>
              Walking with good posture becomes your default. You naturally self-correct when you notice slouching. Feels comfortable and efficient.
            </p>

            <h2>Benefits of Good Walking Posture</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduced back, neck, and shoulder pain</li>
              <li>Improved breathing and cardiovascular efficiency</li>
              <li>Better balance and reduced fall risk</li>
              <li>Increased walking speed without extra effort</li>
              <li>More energy after walks (not exhausted)</li>
              <li>Improved overall posture from daily reinforcement</li>
              <li>Greater confidence and presence</li>
            </ul>
