  {
    question: "How can I improve my posture at my desk?",
    answer: "Start with proper chair height (feet flat, knees at 90 degrees), raise your monitor to eye level, keep keyboard close to body, and take 5-minute standing breaks every 45-60 minutes. Set hourly posture check reminders on your phone."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the 20-20-20 rule for office workers?",
    answer: "Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This reduces eye strain from screen time. For posture, add movement: every 20 minutes, do 20 seconds of shoulder rolls or stretching."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I use a standing desk?",
    answer: "Standing desks can help if you alternate sitting and standing every 30-60 minutes. Pure standing isn't better than pure sitting—variety is key. Follow same ergonomic principles when standing: monitor at eye level, elbows at 90 degrees."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I stop slouching at work?",
    answer: "Set hourly phone reminders labeled 'Posture check!', place sticky notes on your monitor, adjust your chair's lumbar support, and raise your monitor so you're not looking down. Slouching is often caused by poor setup, not just bad habits."
  },
  {
    question: "Can desk work cause permanent posture problems?",
    answer: "Prolonged poor desk posture can lead to chronic muscle imbalances and postural changes, but these are typically reversible with corrected setup and exercises. The key is addressing problems early—don't wait years. Most desk-related posture issues improve within 4-8 weeks of proper ergonomics."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best office chair for posture?",
    answer: "Look for adjustable lumbar support, seat depth adjustment, adjustable armrests, and height adjustment. The $300-500 range offers good quality. Best chair is one that fits your body—test before buying. A $400 chair that fits beats a $1000 chair that doesn't."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I get up from my desk?",
    answer: "Stand and walk for 5 minutes every 45-60 minutes. If that's not possible, do micro-movements (shoulder rolls, ankle circles) every 30 minutes while sitting. Even standing for 30 seconds helps. Frequency matters more than duration."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a laptop for full-time work?",
    answer: "Only with external keyboard, mouse, and laptop stand. You cannot achieve proper monitor height (eye level) and proper keyboard position (elbows 90 degrees) simultaneously with a laptop alone. Using built-in laptop keyboard guarantees poor posture for 8+ hours daily."

          <ShortAnswer>
            Office workers should focus on three areas: ergonomic desk setup (monitor at eye level, feet flat), regular movement breaks (every 45 minutes), and simple strengthening exercises (5-10 minutes daily). These prevent the neck pain, back pain, and fatigue common in desk jobs.

            <p className="text-lg">
              As an office worker, you likely sit 8-12 hours daily. Poor posture during these hours causes chronic pain, fatigue, and long-term health problems. These 15 tips target the specific challenges of desk work.
            </p>

            <h2>Desk Setup Tips (Fix These First)</h2>

            <h3>1. Raise Your Monitor to Eye Level</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The problem:</strong> Most monitors sit too low, forcing you to look down all day. This adds 10-15 pounds of pressure on your neck for every inch your head tilts forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The fix:</strong> Top of screen should be at or slightly below eye level. Use monitor stand, laptop riser, or stack of books. Test by sitting naturally—you should look slightly downward at center of screen (10-20 degrees), not crane your neck down.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Position Your Keyboard Within Easy Reach</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The problem:</strong> Keyboard too far away forces you to lean forward and hunch shoulders.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The fix:</strong> Keep keyboard close enough that your elbows stay at 90 degrees and upper arms hang naturally at sides. If you find yourself reaching or shoulders are elevated, move keyboard closer.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Adjust Chair Height for Feet-Flat Position</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The problem:</strong> Chair too low puts knees higher than hips, causing slouching. Chair too high leaves feet dangling, cutting off circulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The fix:</strong> Adjust so feet rest flat on floor (or footrest) with knees at 90 degrees, slightly lower than hips. Use footrest if desk height is fixed and raising chair leaves feet dangling.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Use Lumbar Support</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The problem:</strong> Without lumbar support, you'll naturally slouch forward, flattening your lower back's natural curve.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The fix:</strong> Adjust your chair's lumbar support to fit snugly into curve of lower back (about waist height). No lumbar support? Use small cushion or rolled towel. You should feel gentle pressure supporting your curve.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Set Up External Keyboard for Laptop Users</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The problem:</strong> Using built-in laptop keyboard forces you to look down at screen for 8+ hours, guaranteed neck strain.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The fix:</strong> Get laptop stand (raises screen to eye level), external keyboard, and external mouse. This is non-negotiable for full-time laptop work. A $30 investment prevents years of neck problems.
            </p>

            <h2>Sitting Position Tips</h2>

            <h3>6. Follow the 90-90-90 Rule</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>What it is:</strong> 90-degree angles at ankles (feet flat), knees (proper chair height), and elbows (when typing).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Why it works:</strong> These angles maintain natural spine curves, ensure proper blood circulation, and reduce joint strain. If you can't achieve all three, your setup needs adjustment.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Sit All the Way Back in Your Chair</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The problem:</strong> Perching on edge of chair eliminates lumbar support and causes lower back strain.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The fix:</strong> Sit with your buttocks touching the back of the chair. There should be 2-4 finger widths between seat edge and back of knees. If you find yourself perching forward, your desk might be too far away—move it closer.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Keep Both Feet Flat (Don't Cross Legs)</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The problem:</strong> Crossing legs habitually creates hip imbalances and reduces circulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The fix:</strong> Keep both feet flat on floor or footrest. If you catch yourself crossing legs, it often means your chair is too high—lower it and use footrest if needed.
            </p>

            <h2>Movement and Break Tips</h2>

            <h3>9. Take 5-Minute Breaks Every 45-60 Minutes</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The science:</strong> Sitting perfectly still is worse for your body than sitting "badly" with movement. Your body needs circulation and muscle engagement.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The fix:</strong> Set a 45-minute timer. When it goes off, stand up and walk for 5 minutes—bathroom, water, around office, doesn't matter. Just move. Not negotiable for desk health.
            </p>

            <h3>10. Do Micro-Movements While Sitting</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>What to do:</strong> Every 30 minutes, do 30 seconds of movement:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Shoulder rolls (10 backward, 10 forward)</li>
              <li>Neck rotations (5 left, 5 right)</li>
              <li>Ankle circles (10 each direction)</li>
              <li>Seated spinal twist (15 seconds each side)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These take 30 seconds and prevent hours of accumulated stiffness.
            </p>

            <h3>11. Stand for Phone Calls</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Simple rule:</strong> Phone rings = stand up. Take the call standing or walking. Easy way to break up sitting time without disrupting workflow.
            </p>

            <h2>Equipment and Accessories</h2>

            <h3>12. Use Headset for Frequent Calls</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The problem:</strong> Cradling phone between ear and shoulder causes severe neck strain and muscle spasms.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The fix:</strong> If you're on calls 1+ hours daily, get a headset (wired or Bluetooth). Your neck will thank you. Speakerphone works too if environment allows.
            </p>

            <h3>13. Consider a Footrest</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Who needs it:</strong> Most people under 5'8" or anyone whose feet dangle when chair is at proper height for desk.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What to get:</strong> Simple angled footrest ($15-30). Maintains 90-degree ankle angle. Non-negotiable if your feet don't reach floor comfortably.
            </p>

            <h2>Habit-Building Tips</h2>

            <h3>14. Set Hourly Posture Check Reminders</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>How:</strong> Set phone alarm every hour labeled "Posture check!" When it goes off, spend 5 seconds checking: Feet flat? Shoulders back? Monitor at eye level?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Why it works:</strong> You'll forget about posture within minutes of trying. External reminders make good posture automatic over 3-4 weeks.
            </p>

            <h3>15. Use Sticky Note Visual Cues</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>What to do:</strong> Place sticky notes on your monitor with simple cues: "Shoulders back", "Feet flat", "Breathe".
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Why it works:</strong> Visual cues catch your attention dozens of times daily without requiring willpower or remembering. After 3-4 weeks, remove them—the habit is formed.
            </p>

            <h2>Quick Daily Checklist</h2>
            <p>
              Use this every morning when you sit down at your desk:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>□ Monitor at eye level (not looking down)</li>
              <li>□ Keyboard within easy reach (elbows at 90 degrees)</li>
              <li>□ Feet flat on floor or footrest</li>
              <li>□ Sitting all the way back in chair</li>
              <li>□ Lumbar support in lower back curve</li>
              <li>□ Shoulders relaxed (not hunched)</li>
              <li>□ Phone/computer reminders set for breaks</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Results to Expect</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Week 1:</strong> Setup feels awkward, frequent reminders needed<br/>
              <strong>Week 2:</strong> Less end-of-day fatigue, fewer headaches<br/>
              <strong>Week 3:</strong> Good posture starting to feel more natural<br/>
              <strong>Week 4:</strong> Significant reduction in neck/back pain<br/>
              <strong>Week 6-8:</strong> Proper posture is automatic, dramatic improvement from start
            </p>

            <p>
              The key is consistency. These aren't one-time fixes—they're daily habits. But once established (6-8 weeks), good desk posture becomes effortless.
