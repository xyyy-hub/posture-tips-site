  "Good posture is a skill you can learn at any age with consistent practice",
  "Focus on sitting, standing, and sleeping positions first—these make up 90% of your day",
  "Simple exercises (5-10 minutes daily) strengthen the muscles that support good posture",
  "Use environment cues (phone reminders, desk setup) to build the habit automatically",
  "Expect gradual improvement—posture changes take 4-8 weeks to become natural"
]

const faqData = [
  {
    question: "How long does it take to improve posture?",
    answer: "Most people see noticeable improvements within 4-6 weeks of consistent daily practice. Week 1-2 is about building awareness, weeks 3-4 show strength improvements, and by weeks 5-8 good posture starts feeling more natural. Full habit formation typically takes 2-3 months."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you fix years of bad posture?",
    answer: "Yes, you can significantly improve posture at any age, even after years of poor habits. While some structural changes may be permanent, most muscle imbalances and postural habits are reversible with proper exercises and awareness training. The key is consistency over time."
  },
  {
    question: "Does age affect ability to improve posture?",
    answer: "Age affects the speed of improvement but not the ability to improve. Younger people may see faster results, but research shows seniors can achieve meaningful posture improvements with proper exercises. The same principles apply at any age—just progress at your own pace."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need equipment to improve posture?",
    answer: "No special equipment is required. The five essential exercises (chin tucks, wall angels, cat-cow, bridges, planks) need only a wall and floor space. However, a good ergonomic chair and proper desk setup do make maintaining good posture much easier during your workday."
  },
  {
    question: "Should posture feel natural or forced?",
    answer: "Good posture should feel effortless once established, not forced or rigid. In the first 2-3 weeks, it will feel awkward as weak muscles strengthen. By week 6-8, proper alignment should feel comfortable and require minimal conscious effort to maintain throughout the day."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I improve posture while working?",
    answer: "Yes! In fact, your work setup is crucial since you spend 8+ hours daily there. Focus on proper chair height, monitor positioning, keyboard placement, and taking movement breaks every 45-60 minutes. These environmental changes make good posture automatic rather than something to remember."
  },
  {
    question: "Are posture correctors worth it?",
    answer: "Posture correctors can be useful as short-term training tools (2-4 weeks) to build awareness, but they don't strengthen muscles needed for lasting change. Use them sparingly while doing strengthening exercises. Over-reliance can weaken your natural postural muscles, creating dependency."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I check my posture?",
    answer: "Start with hourly posture checks using phone reminders. After 3-4 weeks, reduce to every 2-3 hours. By week 8, you'll naturally self-correct without reminders. The goal is to build automatic habits, not constant conscious monitoring."
  },
  {
    question: "Can yoga help improve posture?",
    answer: "Yes, yoga is excellent for posture improvement. It combines strength, flexibility, and body awareness—all crucial for good posture. Poses like downward dog, cat-cow, and mountain pose specifically target postural muscles. 2-3 yoga sessions weekly complement daily posture exercises well."
  },
  {
    question: "Is bad posture causing my back pain?",
    answer: "Poor posture is a common contributor to back pain, but not always the sole cause. If correcting your posture with proper setup and exercises reduces pain within 2-3 weeks, posture was likely the culprit. Persistent pain despite good form warrants seeing a healthcare professional."
  },
  {
    question: "Can good posture help me look taller?",
    answer: "Yes, correcting slouched posture can make you appear 1-2 inches taller instantly. Standing with proper alignment—shoulders back, spine elongated, head balanced—maximizes your natural height. The visual difference is often dramatic, plus you'll look more confident and energetic."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to see a chiropractor?",
    answer: "Most posture problems can be self-corrected with exercises and ergonomic adjustments. See a chiropractor or physical therapist if you have persistent pain despite proper form, limited range of motion, previous injuries, or want a professional assessment. They can provide personalized guidance for complex issues."

          <ShortAnswer>
            To improve your posture, focus on three areas: alignment (sit/stand with spine neutral), strength (exercises for back and core), and awareness (regular posture checks). Most people see noticeable improvements within 4-6 weeks with daily practice of these fundamentals.

            <h2 id="understanding-posture">Understanding Good Posture</h2>
            <p>
              Good posture isn't about standing rigid like a soldier or forcing your shoulders back uncomfortably. It's about aligning your body so your skeletal system supports your weight with minimal muscular effort.
            </p>

            <p>
              When viewed from the side, your ears, shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles should form a roughly straight vertical line. Your spine maintains its natural S-curve: slight forward curve in the neck, backward curve in the upper back, and forward curve in the lower back.
            </p>

            <p>
              The most common posture problems are forward head position (chin juts ahead of shoulders), rounded shoulders (upper back hunches forward), and anterior pelvic tilt (lower back arches excessively). These patterns develop from prolonged sitting, phone use, and lack of core strength.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Check Your Posture</h3>
            <p>
              Stand sideways in front of a mirror or have someone take a photo of you from the side while you stand naturally. Look for:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Is your head forward of your shoulders?</li>
              <li>Are your shoulders rounded forward?</li>
              <li>Is your lower back excessively arched or flat?</li>
              <li>Do your knees lock backward?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The <strong>wall test</strong> provides another quick check: Stand with your back against a wall, heels 6 inches from the base. Your shoulders and buttocks should touch the wall, with about one hand's thickness of space behind your lower back and neck. If you can't achieve this position comfortably, your posture needs work.
            </p>

            <h2 id="sitting-posture">Step 1: Fix Your Sitting Posture (Most Important)</h2>
            <p>
              The average person sits 8-12 hours daily. Poor sitting posture during these hours causes more postural problems than any other factor. Getting your sitting position and desk setup right is the single most impactful change you can make.
            </p>

            <h3>Perfect Sitting Position</h3>
            <p>
              Follow the 90-90-90 rule:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Feet:</strong> Flat on floor (or footrest) with ankles at 90 degrees</li>
              <li><strong>Knees:</strong> At 90 degrees, slightly lower than hips</li>
              <li><strong>Elbows:</strong> At 90 degrees when hands rest on keyboard</li>
              <li><strong>Back:</strong> Fully supported by chair, lumbar support in lower back curve</li>
              <li><strong>Shoulders:</strong> Relaxed, not elevated or rounded forward</li>
              <li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Arm's length away, top of screen at or slightly below eye level</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Your chair and desk heights must be adjusted to achieve these angles. Most people set their chair too low and monitor too low, forcing them to look down and hunch forward all day.
            </p>

            <h3>Movement Breaks Are Essential</h3>
            <p>
              Here's counterintuitive truth: sitting perfectly still is worse than sitting "badly" with movement. Your body needs circulation and muscle engagement. Stand up and walk for 5 minutes every 45-60 minutes. Even 30-second standing breaks every 30 minutes help significantly.
            </p>

            <p>

            </p>

            <h2 id="standing-posture">Step 2: Improve Your Standing Posture</h2>
            <p>
              Perfect standing posture should feel effortless, not forced. If you're straining to hold yourself upright, something is wrong—likely weak core and back muscles.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Stand Correctly</h3>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Feet:</strong> Hip-width apart, weight evenly distributed on both feet, centered over arches</li>
              <li><strong>Knees:</strong> Slightly bent, never locked (locking causes fatigue and knee strain)</li>
              <li><strong>Pelvis:</strong> Neutral—not tilted forward (arched back) or backward (flat back)</li>
              <li><strong>Core:</strong> Lightly engaged, as if someone might poke your stomach</li>
              <li><strong>Shoulders:</strong> Back and down, not hunched or elevated</li>
              <li><strong>Chin:</strong> Parallel to ground, not jutting forward or tilted up</li>
              <li><strong>Head:</strong> Balanced over spine—imagine a string pulling crown of head upward</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Practice the wall test weekly to check alignment. Common mistakes include locking knees (causes lower back compensation), shifting weight to one leg habitually (creates hip imbalance), and letting your head drift forward (adds 10-30 pounds of pressure on neck).
            </p>

            <p>

            </p>

            <h2 id="sleep-posture">Step 3: Optimize Your Sleep Posture</h2>
            <p>
              You spend 6-8 hours sleeping, making it critical for posture. The right sleeping position maintains your spine's natural alignment throughout the night.
            </p>

            <h3>Best to Worst Sleeping Positions</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>1. Back sleeping (best):</strong> Maintains neutral spine alignment. Place a pillow under your knees to reduce lower back strain. Use a pillow that supports your neck's natural curve without pushing your head too far forward.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>2. Side sleeping (good):</strong> Place a pillow between your knees to keep hips aligned. Your pillow should fill the gap between your shoulder and head so your neck stays neutral, not bent up or down.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>3. Stomach sleeping (worst):</strong> Forces neck rotation and puts spine in extension. If you must sleep this way, use a very thin pillow or no pillow, and place a pillow under your hips to reduce back strain.
            </p>

            <p>
              You'll naturally shift positions 10-30 times per night—that's healthy. Don't stress about maintaining one position all night. Focus on starting in a good position and using proper pillow support.
            </p>

            <p>

            <h2 id="daily-exercises">Step 4: Daily Posture Exercises (10 Minutes)</h2>
            <p>
              These five exercises target the most common posture problems. Do them daily for best results—consistency beats intensity.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Chin Tucks (2 minutes)</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Fixes:</strong> Forward head posture<br/>
              <strong>How:</strong> Sit or stand tall. Gently draw your chin straight back (like making a double chin) without tilting head up or down. Hold 5 seconds, release. Repeat 12 times.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Wall Angels (2 minutes)</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Fixes:</strong> Rounded shoulders<br/>
              <strong>How:</strong> Stand with back against wall, arms at 90 degrees like goal posts. Slowly slide arms up overhead while keeping contact with wall. Lower back down. Repeat 10 times.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Cat-Cow Stretches (2 minutes)</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Fixes:</strong> Spinal stiffness<br/>
              <strong>How:</strong> On hands and knees, alternate arching back (cow) and rounding back (cat). Move slowly, breathing deeply. Repeat 10 times each direction.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Glute Bridges (2 minutes)</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Fixes:</strong> Weak hips and glutes<br/>
              <strong>How:</strong> Lie on back, knees bent, feet flat. Lift hips until body forms straight line from shoulders to knees. Hold 3 seconds, lower. Repeat 15 times.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Plank Hold (2 minutes)</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Fixes:</strong> Weak core<br/>
              <strong>How:</strong> Hold forearm plank position with straight body alignment. Start with 20-second holds, rest 10 seconds, repeat 4 times. Build up to 60-second holds over weeks.

            <h2 id="awareness-habits">Step 5: Build Awareness Habits</h2>
            <p>
              Knowledge and exercises aren't enough—you need systems to make good posture automatic.
            </p>

            <h3>Set Up Automatic Reminders</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Phone reminders:</strong> Set hourly alerts saying "Posture check!"</li>
              <li><strong>Visual cues:</strong> Place sticky notes on your monitor, bathroom mirror, car dashboard</li>
              <li><strong>Habit stacking:</strong> Check posture every time you open email, start your car, or stand up</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Track Your Progress</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Weekly photos:</strong> Take side-view photos in same position weekly. Changes are subtle day-to-day but dramatic over 4-8 weeks</li>
              <li><strong>Body scan:</strong> Rate your posture awareness 1-10 daily. You'll see awareness score improve first, then automatic correction improves</li>
              <li><strong>Pain tracking:</strong> Note any neck/back pain levels. Most see pain reduction within 2-3 weeks of good posture</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fix Your Environment</h3>
            <p>
              Make good posture the easy choice:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Adjust chair and monitor height properly (one-time 20-minute setup)</li>
              <li>Keep phone at eye level instead of looking down</li>
              <li>Use laptop stand + external keyboard if working from laptop</li>
              <li>Place frequently-used items within easy reach (no straining)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="timeline">Timeline: What to Expect</h2>
            <p>
              Realistic expectations prevent frustration. Posture improvement follows a predictable timeline:
            </p>

            <h3>Week 1-2: Building Awareness (Feels Awkward)</h3>
            <p>
              Good posture feels forced and unnatural. Weak muscles fatigue quickly. You'll constantly forget and catch yourself slouching. This is normal—you're waking up dormant muscles and building new neural pathways.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 3-4: Noticing Improvements (Getting Easier)</h3>
            <p>
              Muscles strengthen noticeably. Good posture requires less conscious effort. You might notice reduced neck/back pain, more energy by end of day, less need for frequent position changes.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 5-8: Becoming Natural (Habits Forming)</h3>
            <p>
              Good posture starts feeling comfortable, even preferable to slouching. You automatically self-correct when you catch yourself slouching. Exercise movements feel smoother and stronger.
            </p>

            <h3>Month 3+: Automatic Habit (Mission Accomplished)</h3>
            <p>
              Good posture is now your default. You rarely think about it consciously. Your body naturally maintains alignment throughout the day. Continue exercises 2-3x weekly for maintenance.
            </p>

            <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Overcorrecting:</strong> Standing too rigidly causes fatigue. Good posture should feel relaxed, not military stance</li>
              <li><strong>Only thinking about posture while remembering:</strong> This is why environment setup (desk, reminders) is crucial</li>
              <li><strong>Skipping exercises:</strong> Awareness alone isn't enough—you need strength to support good posture</li>
              <li><strong>Poor desk setup undermining efforts:</strong> You can't fight bad ergonomics with willpower for 8 hours daily</li>
              <li><strong>Giving up too soon:</strong> 4-6 weeks minimum before judging if it's working. Most people quit in week 2 when it feels hardest</li>
              <li><strong>Forgetting to breathe:</strong> Tension and breath-holding indicate forcing. Good posture allows full, easy breathing</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>When to See a Professional</h2>
            <p>
              Most posture problems can be self-corrected. See a physical therapist, chiropractor, or doctor if you have:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Persistent pain despite 6 weeks of proper form and exercises</li>
              <li>Numbness, tingling, or weakness in arms/legs</li>
              <li>Limited range of motion that doesn't improve</li>
              <li>Previous injuries affecting posture (whiplash, fractures)</li>
              <li>Structural abnormalities (diagnosed scoliosis, kyphosis)</li>
              <li>Pain that worsens with exercise rather than improves</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              A professional can provide personalized assessment, identify specific muscle imbalances, and give targeted exercises for your unique situation.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
              Start today with these three actions:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Set up your workspace:</strong> Spend 20 minutes adjusting chair height, monitor position, and keyboard placement using the guidelines above</li>
              <li><strong>Set hourly reminders:</strong> Add "Posture check!" alarms on your phone for work hours</li>
              <li><strong>Do the 5 exercises:</strong> Run through chin tucks, wall angels, cat-cow, bridges, and planks once today—just to learn the movements</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              These three steps take less than 30 minutes total but create the foundation for lasting posture improvement. You'll see results in 4-6 weeks if you stay consistent.
