const faqData = [
  {
    question: "What is the best posture for gaming?",
    answer: "Optimal gaming posture uses supportive chair with lumbar support, monitor at eye level directly in front of you, keyboard and mouse close enough to keep elbows at 90 degrees, and scheduled breaks every 45-60 minutes. Same principles as desk work apply—gamers just tend to sit longer."
  },
  {
    question: "Are gaming chairs good for posture?",
    answer: "Gaming chairs have mixed results. Some provide good lumbar support and adjustability, but many are style over substance with poor ergonomics. Look for: adjustable lumbar support, firm cushioning, proper seat depth, and armrest adjustability. A good office chair often beats a bad gaming chair."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should gamers take breaks?",
    answer: "Take 5-minute break every 45-60 minutes minimum. Stand, walk, stretch, rest eyes. Breaks improve both health and gaming performance—reduces reaction time lag from fatigue. Use loading screens, deaths, or matchmaking as break opportunities."
  },
  {
    question: "What causes gamer neck and back pain?",
    answer: "Monitor too low (looking down), leaning forward during intense moments, sitting for 3-6 hour sessions without breaks, poor chair support, keyboard/mouse too far away (reaching forward), and forgetting to breathe during intense gameplay. All fixable with proper setup and habits."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I use a standing desk for gaming?",
    answer: "Standing desks work for some gaming styles (strategy, turn-based) but not fast-paced games requiring precise mouse control. If using standing desk, alternate sitting and standing every 30-60 minutes. Most gamers benefit more from proper sitting setup and regular breaks."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I prevent carpal tunnel from gaming?",
    answer: "Keep wrists neutral (not bent up/down), take regular breaks (5 min every hour), do wrist stretches, use proper mouse and keyboard positioning (close to body), ensure armrest support, and switch grip styles occasionally. If pain persists, see healthcare provider."

          <ShortAnswer>
            Optimal gaming posture uses a supportive chair with lumbar cushion, monitor at eye level directly in front of you, keyboard and mouse close enough to keep elbows at 90 degrees, and scheduled breaks every 45-60 minutes. This prevents the neck and wrist pain common in gamers.

          <KeyTakeaways takeaways={keyTakeaways} />

          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
            
            <p className="text-lg">
              Gamers often sit 3-6 hours per session with intense focus and minimal movement. Poor gaming posture causes chronic neck pain, back strain, and repetitive stress injuries. Proper setup lets you play longer, perform better, and stay pain-free.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Gamers Need Special Posture Attention</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Long sessions:</strong> 3-6 hours common, often without breaks</li>
              <li><strong>Intense focus:</strong> Forget posture during competitive moments</li>
              <li><strong>Repetitive movements:</strong> Thousands of clicks and keystrokes per session</li>
              <li><strong>Forward lean:</strong> Tendency to lean toward screen during intense gameplay</li>
              <li><strong>Minimal movement:</strong> Sitting nearly motionless for hours</li>
              <li><strong>Young age:</strong> Many start gaming as teens, developing bad habits early</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Gaming Chair Setup</h2>

            <h3>Gaming Chairs: Pros and Cons</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Pros:</strong> Cool aesthetics, bucket seat design supports sides, often have neck pillows<br/>
              <strong>Cons:</strong> Many lack proper lumbar support, overly soft cushioning, style over function
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Reality check:</strong> A $300 ergonomic office chair often provides better support than a $500 gaming chair. Focus on features, not branding.
            </p>

            <h3>Essential Chair Features</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Adjustable lumbar support:</strong> Fits curve of lower back</li>
              <li><strong>Firm cushioning:</strong> Not too soft (sinking feeling)</li>
              <li><strong>Seat depth adjustment:</strong> 2-4 finger widths between seat edge and knee back</li>
              <li><strong>Adjustable armrests:</strong> Support elbows at 90 degrees</li>
              <li><strong>Seat height adjustment:</strong> Feet flat on floor, knees at 90 degrees</li>
              <li><strong>Backrest recline:</strong> 100-110 degrees optimal</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Chair Adjustments</h3>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Height:</strong> Feet flat, knees at 90 degrees</li>
              <li><strong>Depth:</strong> Sitting all the way back, 2-4 fingers between seat edge and knees</li>
              <li><strong>Lumbar support:</strong> Fits curve of lower back, gentle pressure</li>
              <li><strong>Armrests:</strong> Elbows at 90 degrees, shoulders relaxed</li>
              <li><strong>Backrest angle:</strong> Reclined 10-20 degrees from vertical</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Monitor and Display Positioning</h2>

            <h3>Single Monitor Setup</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Height:</strong> Top of screen at or slightly below eye level</li>
              <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Arm's length away (20-28 inches)</li>
              <li><strong>Angle:</strong> Directly in front, not angled to side</li>
              <li><strong>Tilt:</strong> Slight back tilt (10-20 degrees)</li>
              <li><strong>Size consideration:</strong> Larger screens (27\"+) may need to sit slightly farther back</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Dual Monitor Setup</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Primary monitor:</strong> Directly in front at eye level<br/>
              <strong>Secondary monitor:</strong> Angled 30-45 degrees to side
            </p>

            <p>
              If using both equally, arrange in shallow V-shape with center point directly in front of you. Main gaming action should be on center/primary monitor.
            </p>

            <h3>Ultrawide Monitors</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Sit slightly farther back than standard monitor</li>
              <li>Center of screen directly in front</li>
              <li>Reduces need for dual monitors</li>
              <li>May need to look slightly left/right for edge content</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Keyboard and Mouse Ergonomics</h2>

            <h3>Keyboard Position</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Directly in front of you (center of body)</li>
              <li>Close enough that elbows stay at 90 degrees</li>
              <li>Wrists neutral (straight), not bent up or down</li>
              <li>Consider keyboard tray if desk is too high</li>
              <li>Tenkeyless (TKL) keyboards bring mouse closer, reducing reach</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mouse Position and Technique</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>At same level as keyboard</li>
              <li>Close to keyboard (no excessive reaching to side)</li>
              <li>Entire forearm supported on desk (not just wrist)</li>
              <li>Wrist neutral, not bent to side</li>
              <li>Use mouse sensitivity settings to reduce necessary movement</li>
              <li>Consider large mouse pad for full arm movement</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Wrist Rests: Use Correctly</h3>
            <p>
              Wrist rests are for breaks, not active gaming. During play, wrists should float slightly above keyboard/pad. Rest wrists during cutscenes, loading screens, and breaks.
            </p>

            <h2>Console Gaming Posture</h2>

            <h3>TV Distance and Height</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Distance:</strong> 1.5-2x the screen diagonal (55\" TV = 7-9 feet away)</li>
              <li><strong>Height:</strong> Center of screen at eye level when sitting</li>
              <li><strong>Angle:</strong> Directly in front, perpendicular to seating</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Couch Gaming Setup</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>The challenge:</strong> Couches encourage slouching. Solutions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sit upright with back against couch back</li>
              <li>Use cushion behind lower back for lumbar support</li>
              <li>Avoid lying down or semi-reclined positions</li>
              <li>Feet flat on floor, not tucked under</li>
              <li>Take breaks to stand every 45-60 minutes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Controller Ergonomics</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Elbows supported on armrests or lap</li>
              <li>Shoulders relaxed (not elevated)</li>
              <li>Avoid death grip—hold controller with 40-50% pressure</li>
              <li>Switch hand positions occasionally during long sessions</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Break Strategies for Long Sessions</h2>

            <h3>Scheduled Breaks</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Every 45-60 minutes:</strong> 5-minute break minimum
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>What to do:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Stand up and walk around</li>
              <li>Look at distant objects (rest eyes)</li>
              <li>Neck rolls and shoulder shrugs</li>
              <li>Wrist and finger stretches</li>
              <li>Hip flexor stretch (lunge position)</li>
              <li>Hydrate</li>
              <li>Bathroom break</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Natural Break Opportunities</h3>
            <p>
              Use these moments for quick stretches or posture resets:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Loading screens</li>
              <li>Matchmaking queues</li>
              <li>Between rounds/matches</li>
              <li>Character deaths</li>
              <li>Cutscenes</li>
              <li>Lobby waits</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Eye Rest (20-20-20 Rule)</h3>
            <p>
              Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Reduces eye strain and forces brief posture check.
            </p>

            <h2>Stretches for Gamers</h2>

            <h3>Wrist and Finger Stretches (Between Matches)</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Extend arm forward, palm up</li>
              <li>Gently pull fingers back with other hand</li>
              <li>Hold 15 seconds</li>
              <li>Flip palm down, pull fingers toward you</li>
              <li>Hold 15 seconds</li>
              <li>Repeat on other hand</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Neck Stretches (Every Hour)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Look left, hold 15 seconds</li>
              <li>Look right, hold 15 seconds</li>
              <li>Tilt left ear toward left shoulder, hold 15 seconds</li>
              <li>Tilt right ear toward right shoulder, hold 15 seconds</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Shoulder and Upper Back (Every Hour)</h3>
            <p>
              Stand up, clasp hands behind back, gently lift arms while squeezing shoulder blades together. Hold 20 seconds. Opens chest, releases shoulder tension.
            </p>

            <h2>Common Gaming Posture Mistakes</h2>

            <h3>1. Leaning Forward During Intense Moments</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Fix:</strong> Be aware of this tendency. Set phone reminder to check posture during sessions. Lean back in chair between intense moments.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Monitor Too Low</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Fix:</strong> Raise monitor to eye level with monitor stand or arm mount. This is #1 gaming posture problem.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Forgetting to Breathe</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Fix:</strong> Intense gaming causes shallow breathing and breath-holding. Take deep breath between rounds. Proper breathing reduces tension.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Death Grip on Mouse</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Fix:</strong> Relax grip to 40-50% pressure. Periodically open and close hand to release tension. Tight grip causes forearm and wrist strain.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Marathon Sessions Without Breaks</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Fix:</strong> Set timer for breaks. You'll actually perform better with breaks—fatigue reduces reaction time and decision-making.
            </p>

            <h2>Posture and Gaming Performance</h2>

            <h3>Benefits of Good Posture for Gaming</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Better reaction time:</strong> Less fatigue = faster responses</li>
              <li><strong>Improved accuracy:</strong> Stable posture = better mouse control</li>
              <li><strong>Longer sessions:</strong> No pain forcing breaks</li>
              <li><strong>Better breathing:</strong> Upright posture = more oxygen = better brain function</li>
              <li><strong>Reduced tilt:</strong> Physical comfort reduces mental frustration</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Research Findings</h3>
            <p>
              Studies show gamers with proper ergonomic setup perform 10-15% better in accuracy tasks and report significantly less fatigue during 3+ hour sessions.
            </p>

            <h2>Daily Routine for Gamers</h2>

            <h3>Before Gaming Session</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Quick posture check (chair, monitor, peripherals)</li>
              <li>Set break timer (45-60 minutes)</li>
              <li>Brief stretches (30 seconds)</li>
              <li>Hydrate</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>During Session</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Hourly posture awareness checks</li>
              <li>Use loading screens for stretches</li>
              <li>Stand during queue/matchmaking</li>
              <li>Breathe consciously during intense moments</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>After Session</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>5-minute stretch routine</li>
              <li>Wrist and finger stretches</li>
              <li>Walk around for 5 minutes</li>
              <li>Eye rest (look at distant objects)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Taking care of your body lets you game longer, perform better, and avoid chronic pain that could sideline you permanently.
