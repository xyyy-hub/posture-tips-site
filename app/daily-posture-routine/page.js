  "Ten focused minutes daily beats 60 minutes once a week—consistency is everything",
  "These 5 exercises target the most common posture problems (forward head, rounded shoulders, weak core)",
  "You'll feel awkward the first week—this is normal as weak muscles wake up",

]

const faqData = [
  {
    question: "How long until I see posture improvements?",
    answer: "Most people notice improvements within 3-4 weeks of daily practice. Week 1-2 you'll feel muscles working (sometimes sore), weeks 3-4 you'll notice posture feels easier to maintain, and by weeks 6-8 good posture becomes more automatic. Visible changes in photos typically appear after 4 weeks."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I do these exercises every day?",
    answer: "Yes, these exercises are designed for daily practice. They're low-intensity movements focused on activation and stretching rather than heavy strength training. Doing them 5-7 days per week gives best results. If muscles feel very sore, take 1 rest day and continue the next day."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I feel sore after these exercises?",
    answer: "Mild muscle soreness in the first week is normal—you're waking up dormant muscles. By week 2-3, soreness should decrease significantly. If you experience sharp pain (not muscle fatigue), stop that exercise and consult a healthcare provider. Good soreness is dull muscle ache, not joint pain."
  },
  {
    question: "What if an exercise causes pain?",
    answer: "Stop immediately if you feel sharp pain. Mild discomfort or muscle fatigue is normal, but pain indicates something is wrong. Common causes: incorrect form, pre-existing injury, or progressing too quickly. Reduce range of motion or skip that exercise. If pain persists, see a physical therapist."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I do this routine at work?",
    answer: "Chin tucks, wall angels, and cat-cow (modified in chair) can be done at work. Bridges and planks require floor space. Consider splitting the routine: chin tucks and wall angels mid-day at office, remaining exercises at home morning or evening."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need any equipment?",
    answer: "No equipment needed. Wall angels require a wall, cat-cow needs floor space (or can modify in chair), bridges and planks need floor space. A yoga mat is optional for comfort but not required. All exercises use your body weight only."
  },
  {
    question: "When is the best time to do posture exercises?",
    answer: "Morning is ideal—muscles are stiff and benefit from activation before your day. However, any time you'll consistently do them is the best time. Some people prefer lunch breaks (energizing mid-day reset) or evenings (relieves work tension). Consistency matters more than timing."
  },
  {
    question: "How long should I hold each stretch?",
    answer: "These are active exercises, not passive stretches. Chin tucks: 5 seconds each rep. Wall angels: continuous movement. Cat-cow: 2-3 seconds each position. Bridges: 3 seconds at top. Planks: 20-60 seconds. Focus on quality of movement and proper form over hold duration."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I split this into two 5-minute sessions?",
    answer: "Yes, splitting works well if time is limited. Do chin tucks and wall angels (upper body) in one session, bridges and planks (core/lower body) in another, with cat-cow in either. Two 5-minute sessions daily still provide excellent results."
  },
  {
    question: "Are these exercises safe for seniors?",
    answer: "Yes, these exercises are low-impact and safe for most seniors. Start with easier variations: wall angels can be smaller range of motion, planks can be done from knees, bridges can be shorter holds. Consult doctor if you have osteoporosis, recent surgery, or balance issues."

          <ShortAnswer>
            This evidence-based routine targets the key muscles for posture: chin tucks (neck), wall angels (shoulders), cat-cow stretches (spine), bridges (hips), and planks (core). Do it daily for 4-6 weeks to see noticeable posture improvements.

          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
            
            <h2 id="how-it-works">How This Routine Works</h2>
            <p>
              This 10-minute routine targets the five most common posture problems: forward head, rounded shoulders, weak core, tight hip flexors, and spinal stiffness. Each exercise addresses a specific area while building overall postural strength.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>The science:</strong> Your body adapts to positions you hold most often. If you sit hunched for 8+ hours daily, those muscles shorten and strengthen while opposing muscles (upper back, glutes) weaken and lengthen. This routine reverses those patterns.
            </p>

            <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>10 minutes of uninterrupted time</li>
              <li>A wall (for wall angels)</li>
              <li>Floor space (for cat-cow, bridges, planks)</li>
              <li>Optional: yoga mat or towel for cushioning</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When to Do This Routine</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Best: Morning</strong> — Your muscles are stiff from sleep and benefit from activation before your day. Sets positive posture tone for the next 12 hours.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Also good:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Lunch break:</strong> Resets posture mid-day, energizing boost</li>
              <li><strong>After work:</strong> Releases tension from day, transitions to evening</li>
              <li><strong>Before bed:</strong> Relieves accumulated daily tension</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The key is <strong>consistency over timing</strong>. Choose a time you can stick with daily.
            </p>

            <h2 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1: Chin Tucks (2 minutes)</h2>
            <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-primary-700">
              Fixes: Forward head posture
            </p>

            <h3>Why This Exercise</h3>
            <p>
              Forward head posture (head juts ahead of shoulders) adds 10 pounds of pressure to your neck for every inch forward. Chin tucks strengthen deep neck flexors that pull your head back into alignment over your shoulders.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Do Chin Tucks</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Sit or stand tall with shoulders relaxed</li>
              <li>Look straight ahead (not down)</li>
              <li>Gently draw your chin straight back—like making a double chin</li>
              <li>Don't tilt head up or down, just slide it backward</li>
              <li>You should feel gentle stretch at base of skull</li>
              <li>Hold 5 seconds, release</li>
              <li>Repeat 12 times</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Tilting head down:</strong> Keep eyes looking straight ahead, parallel to floor</li>
              <li><strong>Straining too hard:</strong> Movement is gentle, not forced. 70% effort maximum</li>
              <li><strong>Holding breath:</strong> Breathe normally throughout movement</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Progression</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Week 1-2:</strong> 12 reps, gentle pressure<br/>
              <strong>Week 3-4:</strong> 15 reps, moderate pressure<br/>
              <strong>Week 5+:</strong> 20 reps, or add light pressure with fingers on chin for resistance
            </p>

            <h2 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2: Wall Angels (2 minutes)</h2>
            <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-primary-700">
              Fixes: Rounded shoulders, weak upper back
            </p>

            <h3>Why This Exercise</h3>
            <p>
              Rounded shoulders develop from prolonged desk work, phone use, and driving. Wall angels open your chest, strengthen rhomboids (upper back muscles), and improve shoulder blade control—reversing the rounded pattern.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Do Wall Angels</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Stand with back flat against wall, feet 6 inches from wall</li>
              <li>Press lower back, shoulders, and head against wall</li>
              <li>Raise arms to 90 degrees (elbows bent, upper arms parallel to floor)</li>
              <li>Try to keep elbows and backs of hands touching wall</li>
              <li>Slowly slide arms upward overhead while maintaining wall contact</li>
              <li>Go as high as you can while keeping contact (don't force it)</li>
              <li>Slowly lower back down to start position</li>
              <li>Repeat 10 times</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Lower back arches away from wall:</strong> Engage core to keep back flat</li>
              <li><strong>Elbows or hands leave wall:</strong> Only go as high as you can while maintaining contact</li>
              <li><strong>Moving too quickly:</strong> This is controlled strength work, not speed. 3 seconds up, 3 seconds down</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Modifications</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Too hard?</strong> Don't raise arms as high—partial range is fine. Flexibility improves over 2-3 weeks.<br/>
              <strong>Too easy?</strong> Hold light weights (1-2 lbs) or pause for 3 seconds at top position.
            </p>

            <h2 id="exercise-3">Exercise 3: Cat-Cow Stretches (2 minutes)</h2>
            <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-primary-700">
              Fixes: Spinal stiffness, tight back muscles
            </p>

            <h3>Why This Exercise</h3>
            <p>
              Static sitting causes spinal stiffness. Cat-cow mobilizes all three regions of your spine (neck, upper back, lower back), improves flexibility, and relieves muscle tension. The flowing movement also reduces stress.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Do Cat-Cow</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Start on hands and knees (tabletop position)</li>
              <li>Hands directly under shoulders, knees under hips</li>
              <li><strong>COW:</strong> Inhale, arch back, lift chest and tailbone toward ceiling, let belly drop</li>
              <li>Look slightly upward (don't strain neck)</li>
              <li><strong>CAT:</strong> Exhale, round spine toward ceiling, tuck tailbone under, draw chin toward chest</li>
              <li>Feel like you're making an angry cat shape with your back</li>
              <li>Flow smoothly between cow and cat, matching movement to breath</li>
              <li>Repeat 10 times (10 cows, 10 cats)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Moving too quickly:</strong> Slow, controlled movement. Inhale cow, exhale cat</li>
              <li><strong>Jutting head forward:</strong> Head follows natural spine curve—don't crane neck</li>
              <li><strong>Holding position:</strong> This is flowing movement, not static stretch</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Seated Modification (for Office)</h3>
            <p>
              Sit at edge of chair, hands on knees. Arch back and look up (cow), then round back and look down (cat). Not as effective as floor version, but works in office setting.
            </p>

            <h2 id="exercise-4">Exercise 4: Glute Bridges (2 minutes)</h2>
            <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-primary-700">
              Fixes: Weak glutes and hamstrings, tight hip flexors
            </p>

            <h3>Why This Exercise</h3>
            <p>
              Prolonged sitting weakens your glutes (butt muscles) and shortens hip flexors. Weak glutes cause anterior pelvic tilt (excessive lower back arch). Bridges strengthen glutes, stretch hip flexors, and support proper standing posture.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Do Glute Bridges</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Lie on back, knees bent, feet flat on floor hip-width apart</li>
              <li>Feet close enough that you can graze heels with fingertips</li>
              <li>Arms at sides, palms down</li>
              <li>Engage core (like bracing for punch)</li>
              <li>Press through heels, lift hips toward ceiling</li>
              <li>Squeeze glutes at top—body should form straight line from shoulders to knees</li>
              <li>Don't overarch lower back at top</li>
              <li>Hold 3 seconds at top</li>
              <li>Lower slowly back to start</li>
              <li>Repeat 15 times</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Pushing through toes:</strong> Drive through heels to engage glutes properly</li>
              <li><strong>Overarching at top:</strong> Stop when body forms straight line—don't push hips too high</li>
              <li><strong>Not squeezing glutes:</strong> Actively contract butt muscles at top position</li>
              <li><strong>Feet too far from body:</strong> Should feel work in glutes, not hamstrings</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Progression</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Week 1-2:</strong> 15 reps, 3-second holds<br/>
              <strong>Week 3-4:</strong> 20 reps or hold top position for 10 seconds<br/>
              <strong>Week 5+:</strong> Single-leg bridges (5 each leg) for advanced challenge
            </p>

            <h2 id="exercise-5">Exercise 5: Plank Hold (2 minutes)</h2>
            <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-primary-700">
              Fixes: Weak core, poor spine stability
            </p>

            <h3>Why This Exercise</h3>
            <p>
              Your core stabilizes your entire posture. Weak core causes compensatory tension in neck and back. Planks build isometric core strength that directly translates to better postural endurance throughout your day.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Do Plank Hold</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Start in forearm plank: elbows under shoulders, forearms on floor</li>
              <li>Extend legs behind you, toes tucked under</li>
              <li>Body should form straight line from head to heels</li>
              <li>Engage core, squeeze glutes, keep neutral spine</li>
              <li>Don't let hips sag or pike upward</li>
              <li>Look at floor slightly ahead of hands (neutral neck)</li>
              <li>Breathe steadily—don't hold breath</li>
              <li>Hold for target time (see progression below)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Progression Plan</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Week 1:</strong> 4 sets of 20 seconds (10-second rest between sets)<br/>
              <strong>Week 2:</strong> 4 sets of 30 seconds<br/>
              <strong>Week 3:</strong> 3 sets of 40 seconds<br/>
              <strong>Week 4+:</strong> 2 sets of 60 seconds
            </p>

            <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Hips sagging:</strong> Engage core and glutes to maintain straight line</li>
              <li><strong>Hips too high:</strong> Body should be plank, not inverted V</li>
              <li><strong>Neck straining:</strong> Look at floor, not forward. Neck should be neutral</li>
              <li><strong>Holding breath:</strong> Breathe steadily throughout hold</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Easier Modification</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Knee plank:</strong> Place knees on ground, maintain straight line from head to knees. Build up to full plank over 2-3 weeks.
            </p>

            <h2 id="progression">8-Week Progression Plan</h2>
            <p>
              Follow this plan to systematically improve strength and posture:
            </p>

            <h3>Weeks 1-2: Foundation Phase</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Focus on learning proper form for each exercise</li>
              <li>Use easier modifications if needed</li>
              <li>Expect muscle soreness—this is normal</li>
              <li>Goal: Complete routine 5 days this week</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Weeks 3-4: Strength Building</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Increase reps: chin tucks 15x, wall angels 12x, cat-cow 12x, bridges 18x</li>
              <li>Increase plank holds: 30-40 seconds</li>
              <li>Notice posture improvements starting to appear</li>
              <li>Goal: Daily routine, no missed days</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Weeks 5-6: Advancement</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Full rep ranges: chin tucks 20x, wall angels 15x, cat-cow 15x, bridges 20x</li>
              <li>Plank holds: 50-60 seconds</li>
              <li>Good posture starting to feel more natural</li>
              <li>Goal: Maintain daily consistency</li>
            </ul>
