  {
    question: "What is text neck?",
    answer: "Text neck is neck pain and damage from prolonged looking down at phones or tablets. The average head weighs 10-12 pounds, but tilting it forward 60 degrees (typical phone use) creates 60 pounds of pressure on neck muscles and vertebrae."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I hold my phone correctly?",
    answer: "Bring phone up to eye level instead of dropping head down. Keep elbow supported on table or arm rest when possible. Switch hands periodically. Take breaks every 20 minutes for 2-3 minutes of looking straight ahead or upward."
  },
  {
    question: "Can texting damage your neck permanently?",
    answer: "Chronic text neck can lead to muscle strain, disc problems, and early arthritis, but these develop over years of poor habits. Most text neck damage is reversible with corrected phone habits and neck strengthening exercises. Early intervention is key."
  },
  {
    question: "How long is too long on my phone?",
    answer: "Take breaks every 20 minutes. Continuous phone use beyond 20 minutes significantly increases neck strain. Use phone in multiple short sessions rather than one long session. Set timer reminders to look up and stretch."
  },
  {
    question: "Do phone stands help with posture?",
    answer: "Yes, phone stands or tablet stands at eye level eliminate the need to look down. They're especially helpful for reading, watching videos, or video calls. For scrolling and texting, you'll still need to bring phone to eye level manually."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there exercises to fix text neck?",
    answer: "Yes: chin tucks (strengthen deep neck flexors), neck stretches (release tight muscles), shoulder blade squeezes (counteract forward head), and wall angels (improve shoulder mobility). Do these daily to reverse text neck effects."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I use my phone less?",
    answer: "Enable screen time tracking, set app time limits, turn off non-essential notifications, keep phone in another room while working, use grayscale mode to reduce appeal, and charge phone outside bedroom at night."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it bad to use phone in bed?",
    answer: "Yes, using phone in bed typically involves poor positions: lying on side (neck twisted), propped on pillows (neck flexed), or holding overhead (arm fatigue). Use phone standing or sitting with proper support. Avoid phone use 30 minutes before bed for better sleep too."

          <ShortAnswer>
            To prevent text neck, bring your phone up to eye level instead of dropping your head down. For every inch your head tilts forward, it adds 10 pounds of pressure on your neck. Limit continuous phone use to 20-minute sessions with breaks.

            <p className="text-lg">
              The average person spends 3-5 hours daily on their phone. Looking down at screens for hours causes "text neck"—neck pain, stiffness, and long-term posture problems.
            </p>

            <h2>What Is Text Neck?</h2>
            <p>
              Text neck is the modern epidemic of neck pain caused by prolonged phone and tablet use. The problem is simple physics:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Your head weighs 10-12 pounds in neutral position</li>
              <li>Tilting head forward 15 degrees: 27 pounds of pressure on neck</li>
              <li>Tilting head forward 30 degrees: 40 pounds of pressure</li>
              <li>Tilting head forward 45 degrees: 49 pounds of pressure</li>
              <li>Tilting head forward 60 degrees (typical phone use): 60 pounds of pressure</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              That's like carrying an 8-year-old child on your neck for hours daily. The result: strained muscles, compressed nerves, disc problems, and chronic pain.
            </p>

            <h2>How Phone Use Affects Posture</h2>

            <h3>Short-Term Effects (Hours to Days)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Neck stiffness and soreness</li>
              <li>Shoulder tension</li>
              <li>Headaches (especially base of skull)</li>
              <li>Upper back pain</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Long-Term Effects (Months to Years)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Forward head posture (head permanently ahead of shoulders)</li>
              <li>Rounded upper back</li>
              <li>Loss of normal neck curve</li>
              <li>Disc degeneration and early arthritis</li>
              <li>Nerve compression and numbness in arms/hands</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Correct Phone Holding Position</h2>

            <h3>The Golden Rule: Bring Phone to Eyes, Not Eyes to Phone</h3>
            <p>
              Instead of dropping your head to look at your phone in your lap, raise your phone to eye level.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Hold Your Phone Correctly</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Raise phone to eye level (or slightly below)</li>
              <li>Keep head in neutral position (not tilted forward or down)</li>
              <li>Support your elbow on a table, armrest, or other arm when possible</li>
              <li>Switch hands every 10-15 minutes to avoid one-sided strain</li>
              <li>Keep shoulders relaxed (not elevated toward ears)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>For Reading or Watching</h3>
            <p>
              Use phone stand or prop device at eye level. This is especially important for:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reading articles or books</li>
              <li>Watching videos</li>
              <li>Video calls</li>
              <li>Following recipes while cooking</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>10 Phone Posture Tips</h2>

            <h3>1. Take 20-Minute Breaks</h3>
            <p>
              Set timer for 20 minutes of phone use. When it goes off, look up and do 2-3 minutes of neck stretches (look left, right, up). Then continue if needed.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Switch Hands Regularly</h3>
            <p>
              Don't always hold phone in same hand. Switch every 10-15 minutes to distribute strain evenly.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Support Your Elbows</h3>
            <p>
              When sitting, rest elbows on table or chair armrests. This reduces arm fatigue and makes it easier to hold phone at eye level.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Use Voice Features</h3>
            <p>
              Use voice typing instead of thumb typing for long messages. Use voice commands to navigate instead of scrolling. Reduces neck flexion time.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Avoid Phone in Bed</h3>
            <p>
              Lying down with phone involves terrible neck positions: twisted to side, flexed forward, or arm overhead. Use phone sitting or standing with proper support.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Sit Back Against Support</h3>
            <p>
              When using phone while sitting, sit all the way back in chair with back support. Don't hunch forward or perch on edge.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Set Screen Time Limits</h3>
            <p>
              Use phone's screen time tracking to monitor and limit use. Most phones let you set daily limits for specific apps. Less phone time = less neck strain.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Hold Phone with Both Hands</h3>
            <p>
              For extended use, hold phone with both hands at eye level. Easier to maintain position than one-handed hold.
            </p>

            <h3>9. Increase Font Size</h3>
            <p>
              Larger fonts reduce need to bring phone close to face. Go to settings and increase display text size. This reduces eye and neck strain.
            </p>

            <h3>10. Do Daily Chin Tucks</h3>
            <p>
              Counteract forward head position with daily chin tucks: gently draw chin straight back (making double chin), hold 5 seconds, repeat 15 times. Strengthens muscles that fight text neck.
            </p>

            <h2>Warning Signs of Text Neck</h2>
            <p>
              See a healthcare provider if you experience:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Neck pain that persists more than a week despite corrected habits</li>
              <li>Sharp, shooting pain down arms</li>
              <li>Numbness or tingling in hands/fingers</li>
              <li>Loss of range of motion (can't turn head fully)</li>
              <li>Frequent headaches (more than 2-3 per week)</li>
              <li>Visible forward head position in photos</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Exercises to Reverse Text Neck</h2>

            <h3>Chin Tucks (Daily)</h3>
            <p>
              Sit or stand tall. Gently draw chin straight back (don't tilt up or down). Hold 5 seconds. Repeat 15 times. Strengthens deep neck flexors.
            </p>

            <h3>Neck Stretches (After Long Phone Use)</h3>
            <p>
              Look left, hold 15 seconds. Look right, hold 15 seconds. Tilt ear toward shoulder each side, hold 15 seconds. Look up at ceiling, hold 15 seconds. Repeat 2 times.
            </p>

            <h3>Shoulder Blade Squeezes (Daily)</h3>
            <p>
              Sit tall. Squeeze shoulder blades together (like pinching pencil between them). Hold 5 seconds. Repeat 15 times. Counteracts rounded shoulders.
            </p>

            <h2>Reducing Overall Phone Time</h2>
            <p>
              Beyond posture corrections, reducing phone time helps:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Turn off non-essential notifications</li>
              <li>Delete time-wasting apps</li>
              <li>Keep phone in another room while working</li>
              <li>Charge phone outside bedroom at night</li>
              <li>Set "phone-free" times (meals, first hour after waking)</li>
              <li>Use grayscale mode to reduce visual appeal</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Average person checks phone 96 times daily (once every 10 minutes). Each check involves looking down. Reducing checks directly reduces neck strain.
            </p>

            <h2>What Results to Expect</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Week 1:</strong> Conscious effort needed to bring phone to eye level<br/>
              <strong>Week 2:</strong> New habit forming, less end-of-day neck stiffness<br/>
              <strong>Week 3:</strong> Proper phone posture feels more natural<br/>
              <strong>Week 4-6:</strong> Significant reduction in neck pain and headaches<br/>
              <strong>Long-term:</strong> Prevention of chronic text neck and posture problems
