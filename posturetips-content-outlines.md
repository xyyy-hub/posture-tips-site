**Key Takeaways:**
1. Your chair and desk setup matter as much as your posture itself
2. The "90-90-90 rule": 90-degree angles at ankles, knees, and elbows

### Content Outline

**H1:** Sleep Posture for Spine Health: Complete Guide

**Short Answer:**
"The best sleeping positions for posture are on your back (with pillow under knees) or on your side (with pillow between knees). Both keep your spine aligned naturally. Avoid stomach sleeping as it strains your neck and twists your spine."

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Back sleeping is ideal for spine alignment but only works for 40% of people
2. Side sleeping is excellent IF you use a pillow between your knees for hip alignment
3. Stomach sleeping forces neck rotation and spine extension—switch positions if possible
4. Your pillow height matters more than pillow brand: neck should stay neutral, not bent

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Ten focused minutes daily beats 60 minutes once a week—consistency is everything
2. These 5 exercises target the most common posture problems (forward head, rounded shoulders, weak core)
